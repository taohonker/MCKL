In this chapter, we introduce the basic structure of Monte Carlo algorithms
that can be implemented with this library. At a high level, almost all
algorithms can be described as the following, from an implementation
perspective. Let $\{E_t\}_{t\ge0}$ be a sequence of state spaces, and
$\{X_t^i\}_{i=1}^{N_t} \in E_t^{N_t}$. A Monte Carlo algorithm iteratively
applies some kernel $M_t:\prod_{k=0}^{t-1}E_k^{N_k}\to\prod_{k=0}^tE_k^{N_k}$,
that draws $\{X_k^{1:N_k}\}_{k=1}^t$ given $\{X_k^{1:N_k}\}_{k=0}^{t-1}$
according to some probability law.

At first this may seem a very strange way to describe Monte Carlo algorithms.
But later it will become clear that, we can implement many always by just
defining proper kernels $M_t$.
