  "body": "# Introduction\r\n\r\nThe MCKL library provides a framework for implementing Monte Carlo algorithms.\r\nIt was originally developed for the purpose of parallel implementation of SMC\r\nalgorithms. But it now supports other algorithms as well. The library provides\r\nbasic building blocks for implementing parallelizable Monte Carlo algorithms.\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\nThis is a header only template C++ library. To install the library just move\r\nthe contents of the `include` directory into a proper place, e.g.,\r\n`/usr/local/include` on Unix-alike systems.\r\n\r\n# Documentation\r\n\r\n[Doxygen][doxygen] generated reference manuals for the\r\n[master][MCKLDoxygenMaster] and [develop][MCKLDoxygenDevelop] branches, as well\r\nas for individual releases can be found online (see [release\r\nnotes][MCKLReleases] for links). A [Manual][MCKLManual] is also provided.\r\n\r\n# Third-party dependencies\r\n\r\nThis library requires a working BLAS implementation. Some of the library's\r\nfunctionalities can only be used if a optional dependencies are present.\r\nNotably, [HDF5][hdf5], [TBB][tbb], [OpenMP][omp] and [MKL][mkl]. One can tell\r\nthe library that these optional features are available by defining\r\nconfiguration macros such as `-DMCKL_HAS_HDF5=1` during compilation.\r\n\r\n# Compiler support\r\n\r\nThis library makes heavy use of some template metaprogramming techniques. It\r\nrequires a C++11 standard conforming compiler.\r\n\r\nThis library has been regularly tested with recent [Clang][clang], [GCC][gcc]\r\nand [Intel C++ Compiler][icpc] in C++11 mode.\r\n\r\nOther compilers might work but are not tested. Complete C++11 implementation is\r\nrequired with thread-local storage as an exception.\r\n\r\n# Examples\r\n\r\nExamples are in the `example` subdirectory, to build them,\r\n~~~sh\r\nexport CXXFLAGS=\"-std=c++11\"\r\ncd /path_to_MCKL_source\r\nmkdir build\r\ncd build\r\ncmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\r\nmake example\r\n~~~\r\nSome examples may only be built if optional dependencies are present.\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\nThe MCKL library is distributed with a 2-clause BSD license which can be found\r\nin the `LICENSE` file distributed with the source.\r\n\r\n[clang]: http://clang.llvm.org\r\n[cmake]: http://www.cmake.org\r\n[doxygen]: http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen\r\n[gcc]: http://gcc.gnu.org\r\n[hdf5]: http://www.hdfgroup.org\r\n[icpc]: http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-compilers\r\n[mkl]: https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl\r\n[omp]: http://www.openmp.org\r\n[tbb]: http://threadingbuildingblocks.org\r\n[MCKLDoxygenDevelop]: http://zhouyan.github.io/MCKLDoc/develop\r\n[MCKLDoxygenMaster]: http://zhouyan.github.io/MCKLDoc/master\r\n[MCKLManualDevelop]: http://zhouyan.github.io/MCKLDoc/develop/manual.pdf\r\n[MCKLManualMaster]: http://zhouyan.github.io/MCKLDoc/master/manual.pdf\r\n[MCKLReleases]: https://github.com/zhouyan/MCKL/releases\r\n",
